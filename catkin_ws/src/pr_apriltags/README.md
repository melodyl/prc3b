=========

ROS wrapper for the Swatbotics C++ port of the Apriltags visual
fiducial tracker (http://github.com/swatbotics/apriltags-cpp).

Apriltags was originally developed by the April laboratory at the
University of Michigan.  The Swatbotics port reimplements the
detection core using OpenCV and CGAL for improved performance.
